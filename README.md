Visualizing a network in Gephi

I am including a word document with the basic info of Gephi and also an excellent 20 min video, from my social dynamic network professor, with an overview of the software.

Steps on Gephi:
1. Import Spreadsheets using Data Laboratory icon: nodes and links (be aware with "As table:" option)
2. In Overview, use layout options. I chose: Force Atlas, Radia Axis and Random layout.
3. On Statistics window run the basic metric (centrality options): Average degree, network diameter find more info about layouts and metrics here (https://gephi.org/tutorials/gephi-tutorial-quick_start.pdf) 
4. On Appearance window, color and size the nodes. I colored by region and sized by degree.
5. Go to preview and set your prefered options. 
*Be aware with Edges thickness, because of the variance of the weigths I had to use Thickness = 5.0E-9
6. Export pdf or png
